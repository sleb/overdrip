# overdrip

An *over*engineered *drip* watering system for my desk at work.

## Hardware

- [Raspberry Pi Zero 2W](https://a.co/d/3hA9lcl)
- [Camera](https://a.co/d/hHTTAps)
- [Pump/moisture sensor/solenoid/hose kit](https://a.co/d/eYo49mx)
- [ADC](https://a.co/d/2uc70RU)

## Goals

- Learn about Raspberry Pi/embedded programming
- Learn Rust
- Make a fun and hopefully useful watering system for my two office plants at work

## Methodology

- Prioritize clean, efficient, modern/idiomatic Rust following best practices
- Aggressively refactor when changes are required. Do not prioritize "backward compatibility" or "migration". This is a toy project w/ 1 user (me)
- Be meticulous about keeping a clean, concise record of the project plan, progress, and important architectural/technical decisions in this README
- Prioritize design and iterate on decisions. Balance learning through implementation vs. guided development
